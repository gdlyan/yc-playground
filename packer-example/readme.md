# Packer Quickstart
This is a creative adaptation of the Packer example from the [Yandex Cloud Engineer Course](https://practicum.yandex.ru/ycloud/). Added the following items that were not covered in the lesson:
- running Packer in a Docker container
- keeping secrets and other sensitive things in variables
- instead of pure Nginx installing Docker with Nginx as proxy
- trying out parallel building (multiple source sections in one configuration)
